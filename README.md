# Kindle Paperwhite (10th Gen) Weather Display

Turn a jailbroken Kindle PW4 into a standalone e-ink weather station that automatically wakes up, fetches weather data, displays it, and goes back to sleep.

## How it works

1. The Kindle stops its GUI and takes over the display
2. It connects to WiFi and fetches hourly and daily forecasts from the [Australian Bureau of Meteorology](https://api.weather.bom.gov.au/) (BOM) API
3. The data is rendered into an SVG template (inspired by the nook-weather project's layout) showing current conditions, hourly forecast, and daily forecast
4. The SVG is converted to a greyscale PNG by `rsvg-convert` and displayed on the e-ink screen using [FBInk](https://github.com/NiLuJe/FBInk) with a full GC16 refresh
5. WiFi is disabled and the Kindle enters suspend-to-RAM via `rtcwake`
6. After 6 hours, the RTC alarm wakes the device and the cycle repeats
Battery life is approximately 3-4 weeks on a single charge with 6-hour update intervals.

## Prerequisites

- **Kindle PW4** (7th gen) with firmware 5.13.x - 5.16.2.1.1
- **Jailbreak** via [WinterBreak](https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/WinterBreak/)
- **KUAL** and **MRPI** installed ([guide](https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/post-jailbreak/installing-kual-mrpi/))
- **Python 3** installed via [NiLuJe's snapshots](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=225030)
- **FBInk** available (bundled with [USBNetwork](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=225030))
- A **2.4 GHz WiFi network** (the PW4 does not support 5 GHz)

## Installation

### 1. Copy files to Kindle

Connect your Kindle via USB and copy the directories:

```
kindle/bin/          -> /mnt/us/weather/bin/
kindle/etc/          -> /mnt/us/weather/etc/
kindle/lib/          -> /mnt/us/weather/lib/
kindle/usr/          -> /mnt/us/weather/usr/
kindle/var/          -> /mnt/us/weather/var/
extensions/weather/  -> /mnt/us/extensions/weather/
```

### 2. Configure your location

Copy the example config and edit it:

```sh
cp /mnt/us/weather/etc/weather_config.sh.example /mnt/us/weather/etc/weather_config.sh
```

Edit `weather_config.sh` to set your BOM geohash:

- **Australia (BOM):** Set `GEOHASH="r1r0k3"` (replace with your location's geohash)
- Find your geohash via [BOM's location API](https://api.weather.bom.gov.au/v1/locations?search=suburb) or use online geohash lookup tools

### 3. Make scripts executable

Via SSH or terminal:

```sh
chmod +x /mnt/us/weather/bin/*.sh
chmod +x /mnt/us/weather/bin/*.py
chmod +x /mnt/us/weather/bin/rsvg-convert
chmod +x /mnt/us/weather/bin/pngcrush
chmod +x /mnt/us/extensions/weather/bin/*.sh
```

### 4. Create screensaver directory

```sh
mkdir -p /mnt/us/screensaver
```

## Usage

### Start Weather Display

Open **KUAL > Weather > Start Weather Display**

The Kindle will:
- Stop the GUI
- Connect to WiFi
- Download and display the weather
- Go to sleep for 6 hours
- Wake up and repeat

### Stop Weather Display

Hold the power button for **20-30 seconds** to force a reboot. The Kindle will boot back to its normal ereader mode.

### Update interval

Edit `INTERVAL` in `kindle/bin/weather_display.sh` (value in seconds, default 21600 = 6 hours).

## Architecture

```
kindle/
  bin/
    weather_display.sh    # Main loop: WiFi -> update -> display -> sleep
    update_screensaver.sh # Downloads weather and renders PNG
    update_weather.sh     # Alternative updater (used by KOReader screensaver)
    download_weather.py   # Fetches weather data, fills SVG template
    rsvg-convert          # SVG to PNG converter (ARM binary)
    pngcrush              # PNG optimizer (ARM binary, unused but included)
  etc/
    weather_config.sh     # Your location config
    ssl/certs/            # CA certificates for HTTPS
  lib/
    python3.7/            # Bundled Python packages (docopt)
    *.so                  # Shared libraries for rsvg-convert
  usr/share/weather/
    weather_template.svg  # SVG template for the forecast display
    error.png             # Error image
  var/
    cache/weather/        # Cached SVG and PNG files
    log/                  # Log files

extensions/weather/       # KUAL extension
  menu.json               # KUAL menu entries
  config.xml              # Extension metadata
```

## How the sleep/wake cycle works

This project uses the same proven approach as [kindle-clock](https://github.com/mattzzw/kindle-clock) and [kindle-kt3_weatherdisplay](https://github.com/nicoh88/kindle-kt3_weatherdisplay_battery-optimized):

1. `stop lab126_gui` — stops the Kindle's GUI layer (NOT `framework` or `powerd`, which are needed for WiFi and battery)
2. `lipc-set-prop com.lab126.powerd preventScreenSaver 1` — prevents the screensaver from overwriting our display
3. `rtcwake -d /dev/rtc1 -m no -s $INTERVAL` — sets the RTC alarm
4. `echo "mem" > /sys/power/state` — suspends to RAM
5. The RTC alarm wakes the device, and the loop continues

The script is launched from KUAL using `setsid` to detach it from KUAL's process tree, so it survives the GUI shutdown.

The processor governor needs to be set as high during the WIFI connection, otherwise the powersaving will prevent wifi from connecting

## KOReader screensaver mode

If you prefer to use the Kindle as an ereader with weather as the sleep screen:

1. Configure KOReader's screensaver to show a random image from `/mnt/us/screensaver/`
2. Use **KUAL > Weather > Update Screensaver Once** to manually refresh the weather image
3. The weather will show whenever KOReader goes to sleep
